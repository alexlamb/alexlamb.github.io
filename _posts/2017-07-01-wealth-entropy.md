Here's an interesting effect that strikes me as a fun place to kick off a discussion about simulations. Give a room full of people a hundred bucks each in dollar bills. Then get them to hand money to random people they meet as they walk around, one dollar at a time. What happens?

I discovered in researching this post that this effect has seen some recent interest on the internet, which is great. You can read another post about this effect [here](http://www.decisionsciencenews.com/2017/06/19/counterintuitive-problem-everyone-room-keeps-giving-dollars-random-others-youll-never-guess-happens-next/). Or see a great Twitter conversation about that post [here](https://twitter.com/darrenglass/status/879332005078544384).

But before you follow those links, here's a model of the random-money-gifting effect that I built for you to play with. Each vertical bar represents a person. (I've colored them randomly so you can see them clearly.) The hight of each person's bar represents how much money they've got. As you can see, at the start of the game, everyone has the same amount of money. Click on the sim once to start it. Click again to freeze, and click a third time to reset. 


What are we seeing here? Well, unexpectedly, some people are making out like bandits while others end up with empty pockets. Why is that?
