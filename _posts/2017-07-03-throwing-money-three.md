Welcome back to my thrilling blog series on wealth inequality modeling! If you've been following the story so far, you know that our notional Conservative and Progressive voices, Ayn and Karl, have decided to test out their dueling ideas in a composite model that compensates both for the effects of cumulative wealth, and for the presence of talent. 

To make this work, every time we pick a pair of candidate money recipients, B and C, we'll take the average of the two probabilities. That way, the likelihood of B being chosen is going to be an even function of both their wealth and their talent. We're not going to try to weight the selection function one way or another. That would make things more complicated and more subjective. 

To show what's going on, we're coloring every bar in our distribution with two colors. The top half of each bar shows the talent of each individual. The bottom half shows how much money they start out with. And now we have two measures of fit: one for talent and one for initial wealth. Let's kick the model off and see what happens.



At first, things are looking good for Karl, but as the simulation rolls on, Ayn starts doing better.

"See?" says Ayn. "Talent will out!"

"But this isn't fair," says Karl.

"Life's not fair!" says Ayn. "Get used to it."

"What I mean is, everyone is immortal in this model. The whole problem with the kind of society you advocate is that wealth is usually inherited, not won. And the talent of one individual isn't a good guide for the talent of their offspring. If you really want to do justice to the effect I'm talking about, you'll have to replace agents with their offspring from time to time."

"Alright," says Ayn. "But the model is getting more complicated, and therefore more specific. The more moving parts you put in a simulation, the more likely it is to be wrong."

"A model should be simple, but not so simple that it leaves out important parts of the phenomena you're modeling," Karl retorts.
