Greeings blog-friends! Welcome to the third installment in my series on modeling teamwork and organizations. This time, I promised you a reveal on the topic of leadership. Specifically, I offered you one simple behavior that would change your effectiveness as a leader more than just about anything else. As it is, I'm going to give you two. But no doubt some of you who've been following this series might be wondering what a sim that only allows agents for four possible actions could possibly have to say about a topic as complex as leadership. Plenty, it turns out. But how?

Paradoxical as it may sound, sims like the one we're exploring in this series are powerful _because_ they're so simple. Everyone knows that people are complicated and that their actions are upredictable. Everyone understands that no busines pans out the same way. Yet there are still patterns that show up in the lives of organizations. If there weren't, experience would count for nothing and no business books would ever get written. Sims capitalize on that. 

A sim is a deliberate attempt to strip away all the subtlety and nuance from the phenomenon you're modeling while still producing the important parts of the pattern you see in the real world â€“ patterns like Tuckman's phases of team formation that we looked at last time. By stripping away everything except what counts for the problem at hand, we can start seeing past the complexity of the human condition. Given some set of observations about how the world works, we discover what must therefore also be true. 

What do we have to play with in this model? Just four actions and two rules. Our actions are the three flavors of teamwork and the one of exploitation I outlined in the earlier posts. Our two rules are the heuristics I mentioned. One: if an agent A is defected against by a partner B, A remembers and retaliates against B the next time they meet. Two: if A and B successfully coordinate, A remembers, and uses that behavior instead.

What I realized was that in order to adapt our model to start showing the impact of different leadership styles were remarkably few. For starters, we split our team up into leaders and workers. Next, we add a little _status behavior_. What do I mean by 'status'? I mean the patterns of dominance and submissiveness we inherit from our ape ancestors that we can't help tracking into the office. 

I've been studying status for years. They've been a staple of the workshops I've run businesses and academic institutions alike. Games that explain how we subconsciously interpret power and give attendees the chance to safely try on new power behaviors are some of the most popular I have. They form the basis of tools for better negotation, better public speaking, antidotes to workplace bullying and a host of other applications. No study of leadership is complete without a proper investigation of what social power is and how to manifest it. 

For instance, to make our company instantly dysfunctional, we make the following change. If a worker is defected against by a leader, they don't feel empowered to retaliate. And leaders are so busy that they don't remember the specific positive interactions they have with workers.

That's it. All other elements of the sim remain the same. But as you'll see, the behavior that emerges is quite different. As before, there's one box to showing the agents themselves, and then one to show the levels of each kind of behavior for the leaders and workers. Click on the sim to find out what what happens.



As you can see, the leaders in our dysfunctional company never get past defecting, but something like an organizational culture forms anyway, even though it takes far longer to happen than it did with our simple team last time. 

Why do the leaders always defect? Because it's the easiest thing for them to do. Not being called to account for their actions means that there's no cost to bad behavior. And at the same time, there's a disincentive to try anything else because they can't remember positives. Note from the yellow happiness line for leaders that they're doing just fine. They see no problem with this arrangement. And everyone else has found a way to get along, anyway. Once a company is stuck in this pattern, you won't see much interest from management about changing it.
