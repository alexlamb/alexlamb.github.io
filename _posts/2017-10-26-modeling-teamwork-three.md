Greeings blog-friends! Welcome to the third installment in my series on modeling teamwork and organizations. This time: leadership. Almost as soon as I built the model that I showed you in the last post, I realized I had an exciting tool for exploring the impact of leadership styles on organizational culture. Specifically, I had a tool for exploring group dysfunction. But as leaderhsip guru [Patrick Lencioni](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions) and many other will tell you, identifying how things go wrong is the first part of figuring out how to make them right. In this post, I'll show you what I found.

Incidentally, Lencioni's book makes some interesting points that correlate nicely with the output of sims like the ones we're exploring here. I recommend taking a look. But we'll have to come back to that in another post. 

In order to explain what I discovered about leadership with this sim, it's first important for us to take a closer look at what leadership _is_.
