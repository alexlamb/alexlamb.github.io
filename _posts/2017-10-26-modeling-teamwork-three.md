Greeings blog-friends! Welcome to the third installment in my series on modeling teamwork and organizations. This time: leadership. Almost as soon as I built the model that I showed you in the last post, I realized I had an exciting tool for exploring the impact of leadership styles on organizational culture. Specifically, I had a tool for exploring leadership _dysfunction_. But as business guru [Patrick Lencioni](https://www.tablegroup.com/books/dysfunctions) and many others will tell you, identifying how things go wrong is the first part of figuring out how to make them right. So in this post, I'll show you what I found.

Incidentally, Lencioni's book makes some interesting points that correlate nicely with the output of sims like the ones we're exploring here. I recommend taking a look. But we'll have to come back to that in another post. 

In order to explain what I discovered about leadership with this sim, it's first important for us to take a closer look at what leadership _is_. There are countless definitions that you'll find in business books, some more useful than others. Frequently they're couched in terms of what a leader _can_ be, or what professional managers or executives wished leadership entailed. At root, though, I'd propose the following definition. 

_A leader is someone who fulfills a coordination role in a social group and who is treated differently in order to help facilitate that purpose._

Note that we've said nothing about power or status or talent in that description. A shared secretary would fit our model just as well. And there's a reason for that. Human beings tend to see leadership through a certain kind of lens. The role of group coordinator is conflated with all kinds of implications about personal attributes and societal value. But leadership in the rest of the animal kingdom doesn't look like that. 

Consider bees. Who would you say 'leads' a hive of honey bees? Is it the queen? She's not making any decisions. She doesn't coordinate anything. She is responsible only for the production of offspring, and by some genetic measures is more like the birthing-slave of the hive than the leader. Yet still the hive makes decisions, for instance about where to forage or what constitutes an ideal new hive site. In his marvelous book, [Honeybee Democracy](https://www.amazon.com/Honeybee-Democracy-Thomas-D-Seeley/dp/0691147213), Thomas Seeley points out that if there _are_ leaders in a hive, they are the scouts. They are the ones who fly out, gather information about food sources and nest sites, and then bring it back to the others. The bees then make use of a collective decision-making process to figure out which scouts to listen to. What differentiates scouts from other workers? Pretty much just age and experience. They do the same jobs as other workers. Eat the same honey. And no one of them is "in charge".

So why do people organize differently? Honey bees have been around a lot longer than us, and are masters of seamless social effectiveness. Broadly speaking, I'd say there are two reasons. 

First, human beings engage in dynamic, socially heterogeneous task-assignment. People take on specific jobs and carry them out to fulfill the requirements of shared projects. Even when people have specialized deeply on skills like say, software development, what one person is writing on a dev team can be wildly different from what the person next to him is working on. Furthermore, the nature of those tasks may vary from week to week. The fact that humans are, in essence 'programmable' with complex tasks means that simple, distributed social models like those the honey bees use are unlikely to work for us.

Secondly, we are apes. And because of that, we consistently conflate leadership with sexual dominance. We can't help it. We evolved from species in which domainant males maintained sexual control over multiple females through physical force, just like lions or elk, or countless other kinds of mammals you can think of. That means that the process through which we pick someone to call the shots organizationally is likely to always be at least slightly muddied with who's calling the shots reproductively. Can we get past that as a species? I'd like to think so, even though the tide of biology is against us. 

But my point is not to get caught up in the weeds of leadership and gender issues. It's to point out that people in leadership roles inevitably end up having differently percieved social status. In the workplace, we instinctively go much further than is necessary to treat leaders as coordinators. We tend to assume they are dominant. Likewise, leaders frequently assume that dominance plays some role in their job. And sometimes it has to. Members of a team are just as likely to buck for the position of 'alpha', consequently skewing a team's agenda out of pure ego, as leaders are to inhabit that role redundantly.
