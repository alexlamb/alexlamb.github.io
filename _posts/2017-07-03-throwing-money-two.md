In the last post, I showed you a very simple simulation that seems to reproduce, at least to first approximation, the kind of wealth distribution that show up in real economies. To do this, all we had to do was equip a bunch of agents with some money and let them pass it around at random. Magic! And we raised the following question: *if this model reflects the real world so well, why should be believe that the rich are anything but plain lucky?* But we left on a cliffhanger. We didn't even try to look at what would happen if some of the agents were somehow more deserving of wealth than others. So let's fix that and see what happens.
