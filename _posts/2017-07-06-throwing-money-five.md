This time, I don't have any simulations to share. Instead, I want to reflect on the sims that have already appeared in this series and follow through on a promise I made last time: to reveal what I thought was the deeper truth that these economic models provide. 

But to make that point, it'll help if I first cover a few other bases about what I've been trying to do.

The first thing I want to do is encourage you to look at the page source for these posts and check out the code. Maybe your not a coder and you don't care, but even so, it's worth taking a look at just how much complexity there *isn't* in these simulations. They're tiny. Furthermore, they don't require much effort to understand. I want you to look because I want you to see that the frontier of science is *right in front of you*.

Sure, there are plenty of scientific disciplines in which you have to get a PhD and study for years to make a difference, but simulation science isn't one of them. And there are so many possible sims you can build that the chance of you writing one that the world has never seen is remarkably high. 

Does that mean that everything you write will be wanted in science journals across the world? Of course not. But unless you're trying to be a career scientist, who cares? You don't have to be part of someone's department to be a seeker after truth. We live in an age when the tools for building thought experiments and testing our rationality have never been better. And yet we're seeing those very tools be used in a way that erodes reason instead of supporting it. The right solution isn't to trust science to someone in a lab who we suspect is cleverer than we are. It's to engage. Because we can.

I don't have a PhD. I got a C in my Physics A Level at school in England. And yet I've done quantum gravity research. How come? Just two things: curiosity and writing code for scientists without getting paid. 

My next point is about the reason for it all. You might say 'why bother?'.







You might say why bother. 
It’s easy to ignore models like this on the grounds that programs are simple and people are complicated. But that presumes that if you put complicated people together that the result must necessarily be *more* complicated. 
But the world doesn’t work that way. Consider traffic patterns. Every driver is a complex, nuanced individual with a completely different set of desires and goals. However, traffic jams all pretty much look the same. 
This is because every pattern in the world that’s emergent - that seems to grow out of the movement of many elements - serves as a kind of filter. Only certain actions that an agent can take will result in larger changes that are visible when we look at everyone together. The rest of their differences get washed out. 
Human social systems often work like this. When you vote or buy soap, the options presented to you are finite. The reasons for your choices can be totally different from everyone else's, but effects will still aggregate. 

Extended intuition happens when we test our ideas. 
We all carry around notions about politics and the power of markets and how society works. We usually never test those ideas, because we imagine they can’t be tested. But if an idea, when expressed in a model, doesn’t behave the way that we imagine, then there must be something we’re missing. 
Costly experiments and data collection aren’t always necessary to improve our understanding of the world. They certainly help, but the fist, easiest place to refine our thinking is to use the tools right in front of us. 
Armchair pontification is cheap. Model-driven pontification is slight less cheap, which is a good start. 

Don’t just look at the specifics. Look at the patterns: symmetry breaking.
Wealth distributions are the clue.
Why do we expect markets to produce magic answers?
