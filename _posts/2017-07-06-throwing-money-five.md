Look at the code. It’s easy.

You might say why bother. 
It’s easy to ignore models like this on the grounds that programs are simple and people are complicated. But that presumes that if you put complicated people together that the result must necessarily be *more* complicated. 
But the world doesn’t work that way. Consider traffic patterns. Every driver is a complex, nuanced individual with a completely different set of desires and goals. However, traffic jams all pretty much look the same. 
This is because every pattern in the world that’s emergent - that seems to grow out of the movement of many elements - serves as a kind of filter. Only certain actions that an agent can take will result in larger changes that are visible when we look at everyone together. The rest of their differences get washed out. 
Human social systems often work like this. When you vote or buy soap, the options presented to you are finite. The reasons for your choices can be totally different from everyone else's, but effects will still aggregate. 

Extended intuition happens when we test our ideas. 
We all carry around notions about politics and the power of markets and how society works. We usually never test those ideas, because we imagine they can’t be tested. But if an idea, when expressed in a model, doesn’t behave the way that we imagine, then there must be something we’re missing. 
Costly experiments and data collection aren’t always necessary to improve our understanding of the world. They certainly help, but the fist, easiest place to refine our thinking is to use the tools right in front of us. 
Armchair pontification is cheap. Model-driven pontification is slight less cheap, which is a good start. 

Don’t just look at the specifics. Look at the patterns: symmetry breaking.
