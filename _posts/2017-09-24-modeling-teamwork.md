Here are three very LinkedIn questions for you:
- _What’s the secret to rapidly building truly effective teams?_
- _What one single behavior change you could make is most likely to massively boost your effectiveness as a leader?_
- _What single cultural difference distinguishes winning organizations from those that fail?_

In this series of posts, I’m going to try to provide clear, unambiguous, scientific answers to all these questions at the same time. How? By showing you a way to model organizations that I find eerily effective. And along the way, I'll show you how it tallies up with existing best-practice and research. 

It's my hope that by the end of this series of posts, not only will you have and understand the answers to those questions, but that you'll be well positioned to answer many more of your own. First, though, I'm going to have to say a little about improv comedy, prison confessions, and the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. Otherwise, none of this is going to make any sense. 

My journey toward creating this type of model started in 2010 when I was planning a workshop for the ASTD training and HR conference with my good friend and occasional mentor, Cindy Ventrice. We had decided to deliver a session on workplace culture change, cooperation, and employee recognition. 

What was I, a professional software developer and scientific computer modeler, doing running workshops at an HR conference? The answer is that I've also always been a keen improviser, and have a long-running life-sideline in running communication skills workshops for businesses, student groups, and whoever is interested in hosting them. Along the way, I've worked for everyone from Apple to UC Berkeley to Olympic athletes. To my mind, the best way to communicate behavior science points is always to get people physically engaged with the material and nothing does that quite like improv games. 

Needless to say, somewhere during my hectic planning sessions with Cindy, I found myself wanting to communicate, via the medium of an interactive ice-breaker, the concept of the Prisoner's Dilemma. If you haven't come across that term before, don't worry – I'll explain. 

Imagine you've got two prisoners being held by police in two separate rooms. Each has the choice to keep their mouth shut or rat out their partner in crime in the hope of getting off scot-free. If both stay quiet, both get a light sentence. If both of them talk, they're both in trouble. But if one blabs and the other keeps silent, the one who talks walks away clean and the other stays in jail for the rest of their life. 

Game theorists use this story to describe those kinds of situations where cooperation with your peers comes at a personal cost, but where the benefits of helping each other outweight the efforts. In these scenarios, every time you do the right thing, you're taking a risk. If you put in work, and your peer does not, you've lost out and they walk away with all the benefits. In game theory terms, they've 'defected' against you.

It turns out that these situations show up all over the place in nature, not just in crime dramas. Every time an animal picks fleas off its neighbor without a guarantee that the favor will be returned, that's the Prisoner's Dilemma in action. Pretty much every act of altriuism or symbiosis that you can find is a manifestation of this pattern in one way or another. And the same is just as true in the workplace. Every time you refill the coffee machine for your teammates, put in voluntary extra work on the weekend to make sure a project comes together, or even just look for opportunities to praise your peers, you face the Prisoner's Dilemma. So perhaps it wasn't so surprising that I wanted to find a way to turn that idea into a game that would mentally stick for our participants.

My first solution was something a little like the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. On the count of three, two players had to pick a gesture to make. Only instead of three gestures, in this game there were just two: an open hand, ready to shake, meant cooperation. A thumb to the nose meant 'defect'. Players moved around the room finding partners and keep a score of their gains and losses. I tried it out at one of the applied improv outreach workshops I was running in San Francisco at the time. It worked okay, but quite frankly, it was a bit lackluster. Somehow it didn't capture the sensation of risk that cooperation generally involves. To be honest, I think my attendees had more fun playing the straight-up Rock-Paper-Scissors game I had them try out beforehand. 

This got me thinking. What if there was a way to combine the two, I wondered. After all, what's made Rock-Paper-Scissors last for millenia is the fact that it's all about modeling your opponent. This is what the human brain is designed to do: social reasoning and anticipation. It's what lights up our neurons like nothing else. That, plus the fact that R-P-S is so damned simple, have made it a lasting component of our culture.

So I made a new game. In this version, players could pull from the same set of three symbols they were familiar with, but instead of the goal being to trump your partner's choice, this time, the aim was to match it. Players either both won in the same round by coming up with the same gesture, or both lost by differing. I took it to my Behavior Lab research group, kicked off around of play, and watched what happened.

The results were instantly very different. People started getting emotionally invested almost immediately. Somehow, because the gains were shared, winning meant more. Failure to coordinate was more frustrating than simply losing at R-P-S because it implied a lack of communication. I immediately knew I was onto something. Here was a trivially simple game that was acting like a micrososm of the human cooperative process.

Then I added my twist: a fourth symbol borrowed from my first trial game. Matching rock, paper, or scissors with a partner still meant you both won. However, if one player thumbed their nose instead, they won and their opponent lost. The only way to lose with this new 'defect' gesture was if two players did it to each other. As I described what the extra move did, I could feel the tension spontaneously rising a little in the room around me.

This time, when I played the game, the results were even more interesting. Participants started watching each others' choices closely. They started trying to bend the rules by finding reliable prior partners to interact with. They started retaliating against defectors. In short, they started _caring_, even though this game was no less disposable than my first version had been. By adding in the extra challenge around coordination, I had stumbled across a variant that far more intuitively tapped into the human social experience of cooperating successfully with others. I knew I had the right game to take to ASTD and win the room. 

The next step, however, was to take this new game back to the computer models to see if I could understand why it felt so different to people, and to discover whether I could reproduce the effects 'in silico'. And that was when things started to get fascinating. In the next post, I'll show you one of those simulations, and explain what I found.
