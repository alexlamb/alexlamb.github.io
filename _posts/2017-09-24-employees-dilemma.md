Here are three very LinkedIn questions for you:
- _What’s the secret to rapidly building truly effective teams?_
- _What one single behavior change will massively boost your effectiveness as a leader?_
- _What single cultural difference distinguishes winning organizations from losing ones?_

And here’s one of my own:
- _What if there was a way to answer all these questions, and far more besides, using a single and highly flexible scientific technique to which you already have access?_

In this series of posts, I’m going to explain, show you how I reached my answers, and then give away all my tools for free. Because why not? But in order to do that, I'm first going to have to say a little about improv comedy, prison confessions, and the game Rock-Paper-Scissors. 

Those of you who follow this or some of my other blogs may have noticed by now that I'm big into building simulations of natural phenomena, from physical systems all the way up to empires and economies. What you may not yet know is that when I'm not building models, I'm often also found running communication skills workshops. I use a combination of stage improv techniques and behavior science research both to teach and to run experiments with volunteers into how people behave in groups. The results of those experiments get fed back into my modeling efforts. This particular technique that I'm going to share here is one of my favorites inspired by that approach. 

It all started back in about 2010 when I was planning a workshop session for the ASTD training and HR conference with my good friend and occasional mentor, Cindy Ventrice. We wanted to deliver a session on workplace culture, cooperation, and employee recognition. 

Somewhere during our hectic planning, I found myself wanting to communicate, via interactive games, the concept of the Prisoner's Dilemma.
